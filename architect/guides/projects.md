# Managing Projects

<p class='lead'>Projects are the primary way that your content is organized within Divshot. You can think of a project much like a folder on your computer: it can contain HTML files, stylesheets, scripts, images, and more!</p>

### Opening the Projects Dialog

The **Organizations and Projects Dialog** allows you to easily manage all of your projects across your personal account and any [organizations](/guides/organizations.html) to which you belong. You can open the dialog by clicking on the project name in the top left corner of the interface.

### Creating a New Project

To create a new project, simply click on **New Project** after selecting the desired account or organization. You will now need to provide some basic information about the project:

* **Project Name:** A display name to reference the project in Divshot's interface.
* **Filename:** This will appear in links and URLs for this project and must only include letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes.
* **Framework:** Select your UI framework for this project.
* **Theme:** If themes are available for the selected framework, you may pick one here.

Once you've filled out the information for the project, click **Create Project**.
