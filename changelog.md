  <h2 id='2013-05-17'>May 17, 2013: Projects and Organizations</h2>

  * **Projects** are the new fundamental organizing unit in Divshot. Projects can contain
    many pages and logically group your work together, like a file folder.
  * **Organizations** allow you to collaborate on projects with a team. You can be a member
    of many organizations and create as many as you like, all on the same account.
  * Uploads are now possible, letting you upload existing HTML, CSS, JS and even images
    into your Divshot projects.
  * Zip export has been dramatically improved and will package up all of the files for a
    project in a snap!
  * Share your projects by generating a unique URL that lasts for a week, allowing you to continue
    working without worrying about changing the shared preview.
  * Preview is now accomplished using a quick toggle button instead of a separate window.
  * Work on multiple files at once with the new tabbed interface.
  * Your work must now be saved explicitly using the **Save** button or the hotkey **Ctrl+S**.
  * Pages now support true full-page HTML editing, not just the body. Add scripts, styles, and
    more just like you would in a text editor.
  * The component panel has been further refined to make it fast and simple to use.
  * Dozens of user interface refinements and improvements.
