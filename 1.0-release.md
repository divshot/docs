<h1 class='page-header'>Divshot 1.0 Release Notes</h1>

<p class='lead'>We're exiting beta with a bang! The 1.0 release of Divshot brings a host of hotly requested new features and a whole new way to work.</p>

### Projects

The Divshot workflow has been completely re-organized to center around **Projects**. You can think of a project much like a folder on your hard drive. It can contain HTML pages, JavaScript, CSS, and other related assets such as images. By organizing your work into project, you can share common resources between related pages and generally get work done faster.

### Organizations

**Organizations** allow you to collaborate on projects with other Divshot users. Each organization has its own projects and team members, allowing easy access to people who need to work together. You never have to worry about multiple usernames and passwords, as you can create and belong to many organizations with a single Divshot account.

### Page Linking / File Uploading

Our new Projects structure also paves the way for potentially our most-requested feature ever: page linking! Because projects work just like a folder on your hard drive, you can create links between pages simply by pointing links to the appropriate `.html` file.

In addition, you can now upload files into a project! Add images, external CSS and JS libraries, and more to truly make Divshot a full-featured front-end development platform.

### Previews and Export

We've completely reworked previews for Divshot 1.0. While you're working, you can toggle on a preview mode with one click to see how things are shaping up (and click around between linked pages). Then, when you're ready to share with others, you can create a snapshot preview at any time that won't change even as you continue to work on a project. This flexibility lets you get work done faster and share your work without having to stop.

In addition, we've revamped our `.zip` file export to be more complete and reliable. Get a complete copy of your project's state at any time for backup or sharing.

### Full-Document HTML Editing

With Divshot 1.0, source-editing capabilities don't end at the `<body>`. Divshot 1.0 allows for **full document source editing** allowing you to add external stylesheets, webfonts, scripts, and more. In some of our experiments we've built full-functioning apps all within Divshot by utilizing services like [Firebase](http://www.firebase.com).

### Revision Tracking

We now keep track of the revisions you make to each page in your project. You can switch back to an old version with just a few clicks at any time.
