# Known Issues Reported by Users

<p class="lead">These are issues caused by users that we're in the process of protecting.</p>

## App Deletion/Recreation

If you create an app, delete it, and immediately recreate it again using:

* The same app name
* Or the same custom domain name

It will cause issues during our app deletion process. The new app you create will not function normally.

If you've done this and notice issues such as:

* Custom domain name doesn't work properly
* New app points to content of old app
* Unexpected 404s

Please [contact support](mailto:support@divshot.com) to get this resolved.
