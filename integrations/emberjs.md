# Using Ember.js with Divshot Hosting

<p class="lead">[Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) is a popular open-source framework for building ambitious web applications. Hosting Ember.js applications on Divshot is a great solution that is easy to get setup.</p>

## Getting started

The easiest way to integrate Ember.js and Divshot is to use the `ember-cli-divshot` addon which can be installed with this command:

    npm install --save-dev ember-cli-divshot

Additional steps to follow in order to deploy your app can be found in the addon's [Github repo](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-cli-divshot).
