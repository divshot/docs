# Monitor App Performance with New Relic

<p class="lead"><a href="http://newrelic.com">New Relic</a> provides a comprehensive suite of application
performance monitoring tools, including sophisticated tools for monitoring
browser applications.</p>

To integrate New Relic monitoring with your Divshot application, you will need
to generate a JavaScript snippet for a "standalone" browser application. New
Relic provides [detailed documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation-configuration/adding-apps-new-relic-browser)
for how to make this happen.

Once you've installed the snippet, simply deploy your Divshot application and
you'll be good to go!
