<p class='lead'>Divshot's canvas gives you the power to directly manipulate content on the fly.</p>

### Editing On-Page Text

Divshot is designed to allow you to manipulate content as directly as possible. To start editing any text on the page, simply double-click it. You should see a green outline around the text and be able to start editing the content.

When text editing is active, some basic formatting tools appear at the top of the canvas on the right side of the breadcrumb bar. These options allow you to:

* Perform text formatting (**Bold**, **Italic**, and **Underline**)
* Create inline links to other URLS
* Align the content on the page
* Create ordered and unordered lists
* Jump to the source code of the current editable text

Editing text is simple and straightforward in Divshot and always takes place right on the canvas.
