# Custom Domains on Divshot

It's easy to get your custom domain set up on Divshot. We've collected guides from the major registrars on how to set up your CNAME. Just point a CNAME record to `your-app.divshot.io`.

If you don't see your registrar here and would like to have it listed, please [get in touch](mailto:support@divshot.io).
