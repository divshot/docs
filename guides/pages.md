<h1 class='page-header'>Making Pages</h1>

<p class='lead'>Divshot organizes your work into <b><a href="/guides/projects.html">projects</a></b> and <b>pages</b>. Pages are simply HTML files that you can edit using the Divshot visual canvas.</p>

### Creating a Page

One of the first actions you'll likely want to perform after you've created a project is to create a new page. To do this, click the **plus icon** in the left-hand navigator. This will give you the option to create a **New File**, a **New Folder**, or **Upload a File**. Clicking on **New File** will open the **New File Dialog**.

The new file dialog allows you to create pages, stylesheets, and script files for your project. You can learn more about other file types in the [scripts and stylesheets guide](/guides/scripts-and-styles.html). When creating a file you will need to provide:

* **Filename:** You will need to enter a file name; this should only include letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores (no spaces).
* **Template:** You can choose to create the page blank, by cloning an existing page, or by choosing from one of the pre-made templates. Simply click on your choice from the tiles below the filename box.

  <h4>Is my work automatically saved in Divshot?</h4>
  <p>Divshot will automatically keep a local draft of any file changes you make as you edit; however, you do need to click the <b>Save</b> button or use the <b>Ctrl+S</b> keyboard shortcut to permanently save changes to a file.</p>

### Working With Existing Pages

To open existing pages, simply click its filename in the Navigator. The page will open in a new tab.

To delete a page, **right click** on its filename in the Navigator and then choose **Delete**.
