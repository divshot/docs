<h1 class='page-header'>Making Pages</h1>

<p class='lead'>Divshot organizes your work into <b><a href="/guides/projects.html">projects</a></b> and <b>pages</b>. Pages are simply HTML files that you can edit using the Divshot visual canvas.</p>

### Creating a Page

One of the first actions you'll likely want to perform after you've created a project is to create a new page. To do this, click the **plus icon** in the left-hand navigator. This will give you the option to create a **New File**, a **New Folder**, or **Upload a File**. Clicking on **New File** will open the **New File Dialog**.

<!-- TODO: Picture of New File Dialog -->

The new file dialog allows you to create pages, stylesheets, and script files for your project. You can learn more about other file types in the [scripts and stylesheets guide](/guides/scripts-and-styles.html). When creating a file you will need to provide:

* **Filename:** You will need to enter a file name; this should only include letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores (no spaces).
* **Template:** You can choose to create the page blank, by cloning an existing page, or by choosing from one of the pre-made templates. Simply click on your choice from the tiles below the filename box.

  <h4>Is my work automatically saved in Divshot?</h4>
  <p>Divshot will automatically keep a local draft of any file changes you make as you edit; however, you do need to click the <b>Save</b> button or use the <b>Ctrl+S</b> keyboard shortcut to permanently save changes to a file.</p>
</div>

### Working With Existing Pages

To open existing pages, simply click its filename in the Navigator. The page will open in a new tab.

To delete a page, **right click** on its filename in the Navigator and then choose **Delete**.

<!-- ### Modifying Page Options

You can change a page's name and folder after creation by accessing the **Page Options Dialog**. To open the page options dialog, click on the page dropdown and then click on the gear icon for the page you wish to edit. The page options dialog allows you to modify the page name and folder.

![Divshot - Page Options]({% asset_path page-options.gif %} "Page Options")

The **Use as Template** checkbox indicates that you wish to use the chosen page as a template for additional pages. If checked, this page will appear as a template option in the **New Page Dialog**.

### Page Templates

When working on a project it can often be helpful to create a common starting point containing shared user interface elements. In Divshot, these common starting points are called **Templates**. While there are a few templates available by default, templates are most powerful when created in service of your specific project needs.

To create a page template, simply create a page as normal and then open the **Page Options Dialog** as described in the preceding section. Check the box that says "Use as Page Template" and save your changes.

![Divshot - Page Options Dialog]({% asset_path page-options-dialog.png %} "Page Options Dialog")

<div class='alert alert-info alert-question'>
  <h4>Do changes to my template also change pages based on that template (or vice versa)?</h4>
  <p>No. At this time when you create a page based on a template the template's source code is duplicated into a new page. We may introduce more advanced templating functionality in the future.</p>
</div> 

### Folders

Folders are simply groups of similar pages that exist to help you organize your work. Folders are also used to help determine batch exports (see the [Exporting and Previewing Guide](/guides/export.html) for more information). To create a new folder, simply click the folder dropdown, type the folder name in the text field at the bottom, and click "Create Folder". Once a folder is created, new and existing pages can be assigned to it.

To switch between folders, you can click the folder dropdown and simply select a folder. This will filter the page dropdown to only display pages within that folder. Note that each folder has a number next to it indicating the number of pages it contains.

<div class='alert alert-success'><b>Quick Tip:</b> The <b>All Pages</b> option at the top of the folder list will show all pages, regardless of folder.</div> -->
