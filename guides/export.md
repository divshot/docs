<h1 class='page-header'>Export and Preview</h1>

<p class='lead'>Divshot gives you the ability to quickly preview and share a project as well as export projects to your local filesystem.</p>

### Previewing Your Work

Divshot does not execute JavaScript in the canvas or allow for testing of cross-page links. To test things out, you can click the **Run Preview** button
(looks like a play button) in the page's top bar. This will enter preview mode and allow you to try out your page including clicking between links, etc.

### Sharing A Project

If you want to share an in-progress project with others who may not have access to it in Divshot, you can click the **Share Project** button in the
left-hand navigator pane. This will allow you to share a snapshot of your project in its current state via URL.

### Exporting A Project

To download a project to your hard drive, click the **Export Project** button in the left-hand Navigator pane. This will download a zip file containing
all of your project's files.
