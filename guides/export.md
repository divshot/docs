<h1 class='page-header'>Export and Preview</h1>

<p class='lead'>Divshot gives you the ability to quickly preview and share a page as well as export pages or entire folders to your local filesystem.</p>

### Previewing Pages

If you want to see what your page will look like without the Divshot interface chrome around it, simply click the **Preview** button in the top navigation bar. This button will open a new window with the current page in preview mode.

<div class='alert alert-success'><b>Quick Tip:</b> The URL of the preview is publicly accessible, so if you want to share a work-in-progress Divshot page just copy and paste the address into an email and you're good to go!</div>

In preview mode any custom JavaScript code that you have written will be executed, allowing you even more control. See the [Source Editor Guide](/guides/source.html) for more information on adding custom JS and CSS to a page.

### Exporting Pages

To export a page's content, click the **Export** button in the top navigation bar. Divshot presently supports two means of export:

* **Export to Zip:** This will export the *entire folder* of pages to a `.zip` file saved to the location of your choice.
* **Copy Source:** This is a quick way to get a page's source into a text editor. Just click the "Copy to Clipboard" button and then copy the text by right-clicking or with standard keyboard shortcuts.

<div class='alert alert-info alert-question'>
  <h4>The .zip file didn't seem to download, what happened?</h4>
  <p>Even though there is no browser download, the `.zip` has been written directly to your hard drive. If you open the folder you chose you should see it there.</p>
