<p class='lead'>There are four main components of the Divshot interface: the <b>navigation header</b>, <b>canvas</b>, <b>component drawer</b>, and <b>inspector</b>.</p>

### Navigation Header

The navigation header is where you will go to create new folders and pages, switch which page you're working on, as well as perform account-related activities like logging out or changing your email address.

The left-hand side of the navigation header provides a folder dropdown and a page dropdown. By clicking on these you can choose from among existing pages and folders or create new ones. For more in-depth information about creating pages and folders, please visit the [Pages and Folders Guide](/guides/pages.html).

The right-hand side of the navigation header provides a single dropdown with account related functionality. You can use this dropdown to **send feedback**, **log out**, **modify account information**, and find a link to this help page.
