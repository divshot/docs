<h1 class='page-header'>Overview</h1>

<p class='lead'>There are four main components of the Divshot interface: the <b>navigation header</b>, <b>canvas</b>, <b>component drawer</b>, and <b>inspector</b>.</p>

<!-- Note: Add full-interface screenshot with each of the parts below labelled appropriately -->

### Navigation Header

The navigation header is where you will go to create new folders and pages, switch which page you're working on, as well as perform account-related activities like logging out or changing your email address.

<!-- Note: Add a screenshot showing only the folder and page dropdowns -->

The left-hand side of the navigation header provides a folder dropdown and a page dropdown. By clicking on these you can choose from among existing pages and folders or create new ones. For more in-depth information about creating pages and folders, please visit the [Pages and Folders Guide](/guides/pages.html).

<!-- Note: Add a screenshot showing only the RHS of top bar w/ account dropdown expanded -->

The right-hand side of the navigation header provides access to preview, export, and source editing functionality as well as a single dropdown with account related functionality. You can use this dropdown to **send feedback**, **log out**, **modify account information**, and find a link to this help page.

### The Component Drawer

<!-- Note: Add a whole-page screenshot with the component drawer highlighted here -->

The right-hand sidebar of the Divshot interface largely features the component drawer. This list of components represent the building blocks of any Divshot page. In order to add a component to the page, you simply click and drag the desired component from the list of components onto the canvas. See the [Working With Components Guide](/guides/components.html) for more information about how this works in practice.

### The Canvas

The canvas is where your page will take shape. Because Divshot works directly with HTML in the browser, what you see on the canvas is what you get when you export the code. The canvas allows you to select existing components by single clicking, modify existing content by double-clicking, as well as perform context operations by right clicking. For more information about working with the canvas content, see the [Content Guide](/guides/content.html)

### The Source Editor

The Source Editor can be called up by clicking the brackets icon in the top navigation bar at any time. With the source editor the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript source code for a page can be manipulated directly. The [Source Editor Guide](/guides/source.html) has all the information you need for working with Divshot page source directly.
