# Known Issues From Users

<p class="lead">There are errors caused by the user that we are in the process of protecting.</p>

## App Deletion/Recreation

If you create an app, delete it, and immediately recreate it again using:

* The same app name
* The same custom domain name

It will cause issues in during our app-deletion process, and the new app you create will not function normally.

If you have done this and are notice issues like:

* Custom domain name does not work properly
* New app points to content of the old app
* Unexpected 404's

Please [email us](mailto:support@divshot.com) to get this resolved.
