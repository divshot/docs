<h1 class='page-header'>Publishing to Divshot Hosting</h1>

<p class='lead'>Share your project with the world using Divshot's integrated hosting and one-click publishing.</p>

Divshot offers all users free one-click publishing of projects to a hosted <code>divshot.io</code> subdomain.
This can be a great way to share your work with clients or colleagues for feedback or even as a complete hosting
solution for your project/application.

### Getting Started

To publish a project, you first need to click the Hosting icon above the project file list in the left-hand sidebar.
Once you've set up your application to publish, you'll be able to release a new version of your application with one
click. The first time you publish, however, you'll need to choose an subdomain name for your project. This will be
the home of the current production version of your published project.

### Multiple Environments

We know that you don't always want to show the same version of your project to everyone, which is why we offer three
**environments** to which you can publish. You can use these however you want, but here's are good rules of thumb:

* **Development:** This can be changed at any time and is simply a quick place to publish work that's still in progress
  for testing or internal review.
* **Staging:** This is where you can publish a version of your project that is just about ready to be released into
  production but may need a little additional review.
* **Production:** This is the "live" version of the site that is served from <code>app-name.divshot.io</code>. Once you
  publish to production we automatically distribute your project to a global CDN to make it load extremely fast for
  visitors.
  
To publish to an environment, you simply click the "publish" button and all of the files from your project will be
uploaded to our hosting system and made available. To visit an environment, simply click its name or the globe icon
next to it.
