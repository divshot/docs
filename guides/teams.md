# Team Collaboration

<p class="lead">Organizations make it easy to collaborate on apps with your teammates. In Divshot, each organization can have unlimited apps and users. Teammates can push, promote, and manage apps from the dashboard or command line.</p>

## Creating an Organization

To create a new organization, use the account switcher in the dashboard:

Fill out the Create Organization form and invite your teammates now or later:

<img src="{% asset_path guides/create-org.jpg %}" alt="Create Organization" class="img-responsive">

Each teammate you invite will receive a notification email. If they don't have a Divshot account, they'll be able to create one and automatically join the organization. After clicking "Create Organization" you'll be redirected to the app list. You can now create organization apps or use the account switcher to return back to your personal account.

## Transferring Apps

If you'd like to transfer a personal app to an organization, go to your app settings:

Click the "Transfer App..." button and select the organization:

## Organization Roles

Divshot provides two different roles for organization access control: Admins and members. Admins can manage the organization and invite/remove members. <b>Both roles have access to every app in the organization.</b> To promote an existing member to an admin, go to your organization settings and use the status dropdown:
