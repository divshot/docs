<h1 class='page-header'>Working With Components</h1>

<p class='lead'>Components are the building blocks of Divshot's pages. A component represents a single user interface element such as a button, navigation bar, or alert box.</p>

### What is a Component?

In Divshot, a component is any reusable user interface element. Everything you see on a page in Divshot is made up of a number of components. Components can be nested inside each other (for instance, a "Button Group" component might contain several "Button" components) and some components are only meant to be used inside another component (for instance, a "Menu Item" Bootstrap component is only meant to be used inside a "Menu" component).
